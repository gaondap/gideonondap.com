Hello, my name is Gideon Ondap. 

I am a second-year Government and Politics PhD student at [University of Maryland, College Park](https://gvpt.umd.edu/landing/About%20Us). My current research lies in socialization, immigrant politics, political behavior, and Asian-American politics. More specifically, I explore how source-state politics influence immigrant attitudes and behavior.

I received my B.A. in Political Science from [California Polytechnic State University Pomona](https://www.cpp.edu/class/political-science/index.shtml) in 2024. I am a proud product of the California Community College system. 

You can reach me at [ondap@umd.edu](mailto:ondap@umd.edu).
